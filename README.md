# React + Jest Starterkit

Simple starterkit with examples on testing with Jest, mocking Redux stores, and good practices. Runs on Node v13.12.0.

- To install, run `yarn`
- To run the Webpack Development Server, run `yarn start`
- To build and deploy your code, run `yarn deploy`


ModuleNameWrapper for Jest and Webpack aliasing is enabled. See the examples in `jest.config.js` and `webpack.config.js` for more information on how that's done.

Happy building!
